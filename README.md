TimeTree
--------

This is a Python 2 module providing simple classes for parsing, manipulating
and visualizing rooted phylogenetic time trees - i.e. phylogenetic trees that
possess a root node and for which the precise age of each node is known.

The package provides two classes: `Tree` and `Node`.  For information on their
use, import the package and refer to the output of the `help(TimeTree)`
command.
